# About Me

**icekat44/icekat44** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mostly working on finding a new job in IT. Was previously working as a digital mapper, but that project ended a couple of months ago. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about coding and a little about cyber security. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on finding new opportunities. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting up to date on coding. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my family; I have 14 siblings, married with 3 grown children and 8 grandchildren. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mwrobbins56@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: my grandchildren call me Baabaw.
